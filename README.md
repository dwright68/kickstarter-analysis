The key components of a successful play's Kickstarter campaigns are as follows:

Plays that kicked off their campaigns in May and June had the most success in getting funded. Campaigns kicking off in Dec/Jan seemed to have the worst luck.

The other main factor seemed to be the amount of funding requested. The mean goal for a successfully funded play was $5,049. Musicals in Great Britain saw the mean goal being around €4000.

Using this data, the main recommendations would be to try to ensure this this campaign is launched by May or June. It would also be advisable to look into lowering the funding goals of both plays to around $5000 and €2000 respectively as these are the funding goals that saw the most success.
